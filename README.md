# Sketch-Transformer

By [Michael George](https://mag389.github.io) and [Kevin Smith](https://github.com/95ktsmith/)

##  intro

An experiment with Transformer architecture and hopeful competitor to
[Google's Sketch-RNN](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/sketch_rnn) for the purposes of completing sketches.

For an example usage of their model see [here](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html)
